 Statical Analysis Tools isolated do not provide good data visualization on main product of software development: the source code. After a bibliografic review on literature, it has been identified that Data Warehousing (DWing) is a good enviroment to provide solution on data visualization. Taking it as a premise, this work has built a DWing enviroment in order to visualize and extract source code metrics, which are objective indicators of quality on source code. Using this enviroment built, it has been performed a study case of source code metrics evaluation of an open source software. By the study case, it was possible to verify that data warehousing provide better resources of visualization and consulting data.
